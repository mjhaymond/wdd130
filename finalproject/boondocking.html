                    The definition of boondock camping, is camping off-the-grid with an RV,
                    but we like to include tent camping this definition as well. It is also
                    sometimes referred to as “dry camping”. This means any time you go camping
                    without water, sewer, or electrical connections. You are camping in
                    unestablished areas and it is important to come prepared.

                <p id="section1text">RV and Trailer camping are the easiest forms of Boondock
                    camping because essentially the RV is a house on wheels and it holds everything
                    you need, from the kitchen sink and stove to the toilet and shower. This is
                    the most preferred form of Boondock camping because it makes everything very
                    convenient and comfortable. Even though the RV holds all the needed
                    conveniences you might need, you still must be prepared because there are no
                    electrical, water, or sewer hookups. You are camping off the grid and you’ll
                    need to think about how an RV or Camper Trailer will function differently
                    without these conveniences.

                <h3 id="section2title"> Tent-Camping</h3>
                <p id="section2text">Tent-camping off the grid can be just as enjoyable as RV
                    camping, but it does require more planning and gear to create the kind of
                    conveniences and comforts that the RV holds. Depending on how much work you
                    want to put into it, you can make your camp very simple and do without or
                    you can bring all the conveniences with you. Things such as an air mattress
                    can make sleeping in a tent very comfortable, or you can use a simple ground
                    pad. A small shower tent can be turned into a bathroom with a bucket, toilet
                    seat, and biodegradable toilet bags, or you can go without and get
                    comfortable with nature! Your level of preparation is up to you.
