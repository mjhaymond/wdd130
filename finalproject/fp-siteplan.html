                <p>
                    Because much of Utahâ€™s land is owned by the Bureau of Land management,
                    Utah might be the best state in the whole country for Boondock camping.
                    So, what is boondock camping? Basically, it means camping in an
                    unestablished area, with no bathrooms or water nearby. Why would anyone
                    want to camp without bathrooms or running water you ask? It may not
                    sound glamorous or enjoyable, but with a little planning and preparation
                    you can gather the equipment needed to make camping off the grid a
                    vacation to remember. Boondock camping allows you to escape the crowds
                    and enjoy some of the most peaceful and spectacular views this state has
                    to offer.
                    My website will go over all you need to know about boondock camping.
                    It will provide you with an equipment list of must have items to make
                    off road camping and enjoyable experience. It will also map out locations
