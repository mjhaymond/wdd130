        <h3>One of my (Merry Haymond) favorite quotes by <em>Elder Holland</em></h3>
        <p> The future of this world has long been <strong>DECLARED;</strong> 
            the final outcome between <strong>GOOD</strong> and evil is already 
            <Strong>KNOWN</Strong>. There is asbolutely no question as to who 
            <strong>WINS</strong> because the <strong>VICTORY</strong> has already been posted 
            on the <strong>SCOREBOARD</strong>. The only really strange thing in 
            all of this is that we are still down her on the <strong>FIELD</strong>
            <em>trying</em> to decide which <strong>TEAM'S JERSEY</strong> 
            we want to <em>wear</em>!
