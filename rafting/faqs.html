                        required to buy all available seats on that boat. Boat reservations need to be done in

                    <h4>How far in advance should I make a reservation?</h4>
                    <p>We advise planning ahead. Some dates, such as weekends and holidays fill up fast, and much of our
                        space is booked a year in advance. We are limited by seasons, weather conditions and the number
                        of people we can take down the river at a time, so it is a good idea to look at our avaliable
                        booking dates and book your trip early. For more information give us a call at 1(800)Run-4fun.

                    <h4>What is the best time of year to go rafting?</h4>
                    <p>Rafting America is open from early March through late October. If you are looking for an
                        action packed adventure, book your trip in the spring months. The snowment is at its peak
                        in the spring and the rivers will have the most water at that time. Summertime is the best
                        time for families and to cool off from the summer heat. Fall will still offer a great
                        adventure, just at a slightly slower pace.

                <div class="q7">
                    <h4>Is rafting dangerous?</h4>
                    <p>With all things in life, rafting comes with it's own set of risks. At Rafting America we try
                        our best to minimize the risks with well trained guides and safty guidelines for our passangers.
                        Most accidents happen because of lack of knowledge and experience. If everyone listens to
                        their guide and follows the safty guidelines you are actually safer in our boats than you
                        are driving your car.

                    <h4>Will our rafting trip be canceled if it's raining??</h4>
                    <p>Anyone from Washington and Oregon knows it rains a lot! Because of this all trips are a go
                        rain or shine. Here at Rafting America we understand this, and we provide all the needed
                        gear to help you stay warm. We have paddle jackets, wetsuits and helmets for your use. In
                        case of extream wearther we may need to cancel, postpone, or transfer a trip.

                    <h4>If I can't swim, can I still go rafting?</h4>
                    <p>Yes, even if you can't swim you can go rafting. Each person is equiped with a coast guard
                        approved
                        personal flotation device. These life vests will keep you floating if you find yourself in
                        the water. Many people who can't swim have a wonderful time on our river trips.

                    <h4>Is it safe to take young children rafting?</h4>
                    <p>We can take children as young a four on our river trips depending on the time of year and
                        the flow of the river. Late summer and fall months are recommend for families with young
                        children to avoid the rush of the spring runoff.
