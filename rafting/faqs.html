                <h3>Can I request a guide?</h3>
                <p>Yes, you can request a guide when you make your reservation. We will do our
                    best to place that guide on your trip, whenever possible. </p>
                <h3>What should I wear to the river trip?</h3>
                <p>The type of clothing and how much your should bring will depend on the time of
                    year, the weather, the water temperature and the length of the river run. A list
                    of what you should bring will be included in your itinerary once you've booked
                    your trip. Keep in mind that if you book a trip in the spring or fall, or tend to get
                    cold easily you bring non-cotton clothing to layer. </p>
                <h3>Can I reserve a boat for just my family?</h3>
                <p>Yes, you can reserve a boat for just your family, but in order to do this you will be
                    required to buy all available seats on that boat. Boat reservations need to be done in
                    advance with our office.
                </p>
                <h3>What is the cancellation policy?</h3>
                <p>We understand that sometimes plans change and a cancellation may be necessary. But
                    when you make a reservation we are turning other customers away in order to hold space
                    for you and it can be difficult to fill those seats at the last minute. Cancellations
                    need to be done at least two weeks prior to the trip date. A cancellation fee of $25 pre
                    person will be chaged. Cancellations made after the two week mark will receive no refund.
                    You may transfer the trip to another person, with no penalty.</p>
                <h3>How far in advance should I make a reservation?</h3>
                <p>Planning ahead is very important when planning a rafting trip with Rafting America. Some
                    dates, such as weekends and holidays fill up fast. Much of our space is booked a year in
                    advance. We are limited by seasons, weather conditions and the number of people we can take
                    down the river at a time, so it is a good idea to look at our avaliable booking dates and
                    book your trip early.</p>
                <h3>Will our rafting trip be canceled if it's raining??</h3>
                <p>Anyone from Washington and Oregon knows it rains a lot! Because of this all trips are a go
                    rain or shine. Here at Rafting America we understand this, and we provide all the needed
                    gear to help you stay warm. We have paddle jackets, wetsuits and helmets for your use. In
                    case of extream wearther we may need to cancel, postpone, or transfer a trip. </p>
                <h3>Is rafting dangerous?</h3>
                <p>With all things in life, rafting comes with it's own set of risks. At Rafting America we try
                    our best to minimize the risks with well trained guides and safty guidelines for our passangers.
                    Most accidents happen because of lack of knowledge and experience. If everyone listens to
                    their guide and follows the safty guidelines you are actually safer in our boats than you
                    are driving your car. </p>
                <h3>What is the best time of year to go rafting?</h3>
                <p>Rafting America is open from early March through late October. If you are looking for an
                    action packed adventure, book your trip in the spring months. The snowment is at its peak
                    in the spring and the rivers will have the most water at that time. Summertime is the best
                    time for families and to cool off from the summer heat. Fall will still offer a great
                    adventure, just at a slightly slower pace. </p>
                <h3>If I can't swim, can I still go rafting?</h3>
                <p>Yes, even if you can't swim you can go rafting. Each person is equiped with a coast guard approved
                    personal flotation device. These life vests will keep you floating if you find yourself in
                    the water. Many people who can't swim have a wonderful time on our river trips. </p>
                <h3>Is it safe to take young children rafting?</h3>
                <p>We can take children as young a four on our river trips depending on the time of year and
                    the flow of the river. Late summer and fall months are recommend for families with young
                    children to avoid the rush of the spring runoff. </p>
